Hi. I'm Dwwab. I have a strong passion in game development. I'm currently working on creating my own game engine and other game tools. I am also learning front end web development and plan to learn back end web development. I really like learning how things work under the hood and creating stuff at a low level. The things I do outside of developing things are music production and learning things like math and science.
